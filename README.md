# COMP20270: Playlist Program

## Description
This program enables users to create a playlist by adding tracks based on their track IDs. The available tracks will be read in via a CSV file. Users can add and remove tracks from this playlist, shuffle the playlist, sort the playlist, and display the playlist. When the playlist is displayed, the total playlist time is also displayed. This is calculated by adding up the times associated with all individual tracks in the playlist.
